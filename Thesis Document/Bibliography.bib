  abstract  = {Due to a steeply growing number of energy assets, the increasingly decentralized and segmented energy sector fuels the potential for new digital use cases. In this paper, we focus our attention on the application field of asset logging, which addresses the collection, documentation, and usage of relevant asset data for direct or later verification. We identified a number of promising use cases that so far have not been implemented; supposedly due to the lack of a suitable technical infrastructure. Besides the high degree of complexity associated with various stakeholders and the diversity of assets involved, the main challenge we found in asset logging use cases is to guarantee the tamper-resistance and integrity of the stored data while meeting scalability, addressing cost requirements, and protecting sensitive data. Against this backdrop, we present a blockchain-based platform and argue that it can meet all identified requirements. Our proposed technical solution hierarchically aggregates data in Merkle trees and leverages Merkle proofs for the efficient and privacy-preserving verification of data integrity, thereby ensuring scalability even for highly frequent data logging. By connecting all stakeholders and assets involved on the platform through bilateral and authenticated communication channels and adding a blockchain as a shared foundation of trust, we implement a wide range of asset logging use cases and provide the basis for leveraging platform effects in future use cases that build on verifiable data. Along with the technical aspects of our solution, we discuss the challenges of its practical implementation in the energy sector and the next steps for testing in a regulatory sandbox approach.},

In this context, the blockchain approach can be employed to foster this decentralized energy market. Our goal is to determine the design that should allow a Distribution System Operator (DSO) to accept peer-to-peer energy exchanges based on a distributed ledger supported by the blockchain technology. To this end, we will evaluate several designs based on criteria such as acceptance of the wholesale/retail market, the resilience of the consensus to approve a block, the accuracy, traceability, privacy and security of the proposed schemes.},

  abstract = {A purely  peer-to-peer  version  of  electronic  cash  would  allow online
payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a 
financial institution.  Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main 
benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. 
We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. 
The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of 
hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing 
the proof-of-work.  The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of 
events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power.  As 
long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to 
attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers.  The 
network itself requires minimal structure.  Messages are broadcast on a best effort 
basis,  and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at  will,  accepting the longest 
proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

  abstract  = {The proliferation of prosumers generates the opportunity to have a more decentralized and open energy market. Given this opportunity, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) trading energy paradigm appears, where consumers and prosumers can exchange energy without the need for an intermediary. Because P2P energy trading plays a fundamental role in the proliferation of renewable energies and the system flexibility for a low-carbon energy transition, this paper provides a review of the P2P energy trading that is necessary to understand the current approaches, challenges, and future research that should be conducted in this area. As a result, areas for consideration were identified and grouped into the following six topics: (1) trading platform, (2) blockchain, (3) game theory, (4) simulation, (5) optimization, and (6) algorithms. The study concludes by identifying several challenges that may give way to future research, such as integrating generation, transmission, and distribution into studies, large-scale studies, and modeling of consumer and prosumer complex behavior. Given P2P energy trading is a relatively new topic, there is still much work to be done to successfully implement the real-world model.},

  abstract  = {Given the ongoing transition towards a more decentralised and adaptive energy system, the potential of blockchain-enabled smart contracts for the energy sector is being increasingly recognised. Due to their selfexecuting, customisable and tamper-proof nature, they are seen as a key technology for enabling the transition to a more efficient, transparent and transactive energy market. The applications of smart contracts include coordination of smart electric vehicle charging, automated demand-side response, peer-to-peer energy trading and allocation of the control duties amongst the network operators. Nevertheless, their use in the energy sector is still in its early stages as there are many open challenges related to security, privacy, scalability and billing. In this paper, we systematically review 178 peer-reviewed publications and 13 innovation projects, providing a thorough analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of smart contracts used in the energy sector. This work offers a broad perspective on the opportunities and challenges that stakeholders using this technology face, in both current and emergent markets, such as peer-to-peer energy trading platforms. To provide a roadmap for researchers and practitioners interested in the technology, we propose a systematic model of the smart contracting process, by developing a novel 6-layer architecture, as well as presenting a sample energy contract in pseudocode form and as open-source code. Our analysis focuses on the two mainstream application areas we identify for smart contract use in this area: energy and flexibility trading, and distributed control. The paper concludes with a comprehensive, critical discussion of the advantages and challenges that must be addressed in the area of smart contracts and blockchains in energy, and a set of recommendations that researchers and developers should consider when applying smart contracts to energy system settings.},

Being embedded in blockchains, smart contracts enable the contractual terms of an agreement to be enforced automatically without the intervention of a trusted third party. As a result, smart contracts can cut down administration and save services costs, improve the efficiency of business processes and reduce the risks. Although smart contracts are promising to drive the new wave of innovation in business processes, there are a number of challenges to be tackled. This paper presents a survey on smart contracts. We first introduce blockchains and smart contracts. We then present the challenges in smart contracts as well as recent technical advances. We also compare typical smart contract platforms and give a categorization of smart contract applications along with some representative examples.}
